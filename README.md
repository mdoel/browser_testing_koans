Browser Testing Koans

The Browser Testing Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn
how to test web applications in an automated fashion using Ruby.
This has been *heavily* inspired by the EdgeCase Ruby Koans.

Before you begin, you'll need to make sure you have chromedriver and geckodriver
installed. Instructions are in the about_driving_browsers.rb file which also serves
to ensure you're ready for the stuff that follows.

In its current state, this suite will give you insight into using Ruby and the
selenium-webdriver gem to automate browser interaction, both in headed and headless
fashion. We aim to extend this project to also include testing frameworks built
on top of that - namely Capybara and Watir.

If you just want to take the koans, head on over to http://browserkoans.com and
follow the instructions there. That site includes a test page that these koans
make use of. The site is a static jekyll site that exists on the gh-pages branch of
this repository.
